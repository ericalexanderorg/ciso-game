## About

This is a game inspired by [devops.games](https://devops.games). Where that game is a tool to teach DevOps tradeoffs by playing the role of a CTO, this is a tool to teach what goes into building a security program with a limited budget. 

Some ways I've used this game:

1. To teach those interested in security.
2. In interviews as a tool to spark conversations and understand a candidates domain knowledge.

The current state of the game is still a little rough around the edges, but you can play it at https://ericalexander.org/ciso-game
